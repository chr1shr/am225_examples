Gnuplot binary output example
=============================
This directory contains a small example for doing binary output that is
suitable to be read by Gnuplot. To test it, use the following steps:

1. Edit the Makefile to ensure that the compiler and flags are correct
for your system.

2. Type "make" to compile the code.

3. Run the example program with "./gp_test". This will create a test output
file called "test_out.gnu".

4. In Gnuplot, type

splot 'test_out.gnu' matrix binary

This can be abbreviated to

sp 'test.out' mat bin
