Miscellaneous files
===================
This directory contains several auxiliary files that support the main example
programs:

- It contains a small configuration file "qtprefs/qt" that is used by the
  Gnuplot movie-making scripts, to configure the qt_tools utility on the
  Mac.

- It contains an example program for making PNG images using the libpng
  library (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html).

PNG output example
==================
The file write_png.cc contains a function write_png that takes a 2D array of
(R,G,B) color values and creates a PNG image from them, using the libpng
library. The libpng library is a available as a standard package in most
package distribution systems (e.g. MacPorts on the Mac, Cygwin on Windows).

To compile the programs in this directory, you should first install the libpng
library, and ensure that your config.mk file in the top level directory
defines the variables png_iflags and png_lflags. The templates in the config
directory already do this.

The directory contains a file called wpng_example.cc that uses the write_png
function to make a PNG image, which is saved to "test.png".
