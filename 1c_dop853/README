DOP853 - the eighth-order Dormand-Prince integrator
===================================================
DOP853 is a twelve-step, eighth-order Runge-Kutta method that uses embedded
5th and 3rd order schemes for adaptive step size selection. The method from
Dormand and Prince, which is described in detail in Hairer et al., is one of
the best high-order general purpose integrators available.

Hairer et al. have a Fortran version of DOP853 available online. This
directory contains a C++ version where the integrator is rewritten into a
class. Two front-end programs are provided:

- d_test.cc tests the code on the Brusselator test problem. It creates output
  files called 'dt.out1' that contains the integration steps, and 'dt.out2'
  that contains dense output based on seventh-order polynomials.

- brus_conv.cc tests the precision of the code for various different numbers
  of function evaluations.

Note that this code was written by CHR for a different purpose and so some
parts of the C++ class are different from the other demo codes. In particular
the solution vector is called w instead of q.
